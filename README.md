This is the official GitHub Repository of the OWASP Smart Contract Security (SCS) project. This comprehensive initiative provides security standards, guidance, and resources for smart contract development, auditing, and verification. The SCS ecosystem consists of interconnected sub-projects that complement one another to promote robust security practices and compliance in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps) and EVM-based blockchain systems.


## üìö **Overview**

The SCS project is structured around several interrelated resources, each serving a distinct purpose in the lifecycle of smart contract security:

- **[OWASP Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)](https://scs.owasp.org/SCSVS):** A baseline security standard designed to help developers, auditors, and organizations assess the security posture of smart contracts.
- **[OWASP Smart Contract Security Testing Guide (SCSTG)](https://scs.owasp.org/SCSTG):** A comprehensive testing guide with practical methodologies for auditing and testing smart contracts.
- **[OWASP Smart Contract Weakness Enumeration (SCWE)](https://scs.owasp.org/SCWE):** A classification scheme of common vulnerabilities and weaknesses in smart contracts.
- **[OWASP Smart Contract Top 10](https://scs.owasp.org/sctop10):** A curated list of the top 10 most critical risks in smart contracts.
- **[OWASP SCS Checklist](https://scs.owasp.org/checklists):** A practical, actionable checklist for verifying compliance with the SCSVS controls and implementing security best practices.

## üîó **How These Components Complement Each Other**

1. **SCSVS**: The foundation of the project, providing a structured framework of security controls.
2. **SCSTG**: Demonstrates how to test and validate controls defined in the SCSVS.
3. **SCWE**: Maps weaknesses to relevant controls, helping in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities effectively.
4. **Smart Contract Top 10**: Raises awareness of critical risks, offering insights into prioritizing security measures.
5. **SCS Checklist**: Serves as a practical, implementation-ready tool for quick verification of controls.

These resources are designed to work together seamlessly, creating a unified ecosystem for smart contract security.

## üéØ **Purpose and Goals**

- Establish a **unified security standard** for smart contract development and auditing.
- Provide **actionable testing methodologies** and resources for security practitioners.
- Create a **taxonomy of vulnerabilities** to help developers and auditors identify and address common issues.
- Enable **compliance** with security best practices through practical tools like checklists.
- Foster a **community-driven approach** to advancing smart contract security.
