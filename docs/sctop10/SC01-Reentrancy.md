## Vulnerability: Reentrancy

### Description:
A reentrancy attack exploits the vulnerability in smart contracts when a function makes an external call to another contract before updating its own state. This allows the external contract, possibly malicious, to reenter the original function and repeat certain actions, like withdrawals, using the same state. Through such attacks, an attacker can possibly drain all the funds from a contract.

### Example (DAO Hack):
```
function splitDAO(uint _proposalID, address _newCurator) noEther onlyTokenholders returns (bool _success) {
    ...

    uint fundsToBeMoved = (balances[msg.sender] * p.splitData[0].splitBalance) / p.splitData[0].totalSupply;
    //Since the balance is never updated the attacker can pass this modifier several times 
    if (p.splitData[0].newDAO.createTokenProxy.value(fundsToBeMoved)(msg.sender) == false) throw;

    ...

    // Burn DAO Tokens
    // Funds are transferred before the balance is updated

    Transfer(msg.sender, 0, balances[msg.sender]);
    withdrawRewardFor(msg.sender); // be nice, and get his rewards
    // Only now after the funds are transferred is the balance updated
    totalSupply -= balances[msg.sender];
    paidOut[msg.sender] = 0;
    return true;
}
```
### Impact:
- The most immediate and impactful consequence is the draining of funds. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to withdraw more money than they are entitled to, potentially emptying the contract's balance completely.
- An attacker can trigger unauthorized function calls. This can lead to unintended actions being executed within the contract or related systems.

### Remediation:
- Always ensure that every state change happens before calling external contracts, i.e., update balances or code internally before calling external code.
- Use function modifiers that prevent reentrancy, like Open Zepplinâ€™s Re-entrancy Guard.
