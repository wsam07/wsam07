## About the Standard

The **Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)** is a list of specific security requirements or tests for smart contracts, primarily written in Solidity and deployed on EVM-based blockchains. These requirements are intended to be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, tool vendors, and consumers to define, build, test, and verify secure smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain protocols. The standard promotes best practices for ensuring the security and integrity of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.

The **Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)** is built upon the initial research performed into smart contract security by various blockchain security experts. Much of the concept, structure, boilerplate, and tooling for the SCSVS has been adapted from the OWASP ASVS project. We extend our gratitude to all those previously involved in the OWASP ASVS for their contributions.

The OWASP SCSVS project was initiated to share the knowledge gained from the CredShields Security Team's research into Smart Contract security while developing [SolidityScan.com](https://solidityscan.com), an AI-powered vulnerability scanner for Smart Contracts. We extend our gratitude to [CredShields](https://credshields.com) for their efforts in defining the initial requirements and founding this project.
