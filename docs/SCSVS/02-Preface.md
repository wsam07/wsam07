# Preface

Welcome to the alpha release of the **OWASP Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)**, which serves as a framework for assessing the security of smart contracts built on **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains**, specifically those developed using **Solidity**.

Smart contracts are autonomous programs that execute on decentralized blockchain networks, facilitating a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), governance systems, and tokenized assets. However, the immutability and high-value nature of blockchain ecosystems introduce unique risks and challenges. This makes security in smart contract development not only critical but also highly specialized.

The SCSVS aims to provide **comprehensive, actionable guidelines** that support developers, auditors, security professionals, and architects in building and maintaining secure smart contracts, particularly within the Solidity ecosystem on EVM-based blockchains. It seeks to address common and emerging vulnerabilities, such as **reentrancy attacks**, **integer overflows/underflows**, **gas optimization issues**, and **economic attacks**—all of which pose significant risks to smart contract security and user trust.

This alpha release is the result of a collaborative effort by professionals and experts across various sectors, including blockchain security, financial technology, and decentralized application (dApp) development. The SCSVS is designed to offer **flexible and evolving guidance** for securing smart contracts, addressing both **functional** and **non-functional security aspects**.

### Scope and Purpose

The SCSVS provides detailed verification requirements that focus on the **design**, **implementation**, and **testing** phases of smart contract development. It seeks to guide stakeholders through:

- **Designing with security in mind**: Ensuring that security is a core principle during the planning stages of smart contract development.
- **Implementing secure coding practices**: Emphasizing Solidity-specific security measures to mitigate risks inherent to the EVM environment.
- **Auditing and Testing**: Offering best practices for conducting rigorous security audits, penetration testing, and ongoing monitoring of smart contracts once deployed.

This standard is particularly relevant for developers who work on **DeFi protocols**, **token contracts**, **decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**, and any application that interacts with assets or governance in a decentralized manner. Its guidelines are aligned with the broader needs of the Ethereum and EVM-based blockchain ecosystems, though many principles apply to other smart contract platforms as well.

### A Collaborative Effort

The security challenges facing smart contract developers are constantly evolving, as adversaries seek new ways to exploit weaknesses in decentralized systems. The **SCSVS alpha release** is designed to be a starting point, and we openly invite contributions from the community to help expand, refine, and adapt these guidelines.

We understand that no security standard can be entirely comprehensive, especially in the dynamic field of blockchain technology, which is rapidly advancing. The aim is to foster **collaboration** and **continuous improvement**. Your feedback and active participation will be invaluable in ensuring that the SCSVS remains practical, effective, and up to date with emerging threats and technologies.

### Looking Ahead

The OWASP Smart Contract Security Verification Standard is not a final document. This alpha release is the foundation for a **living standard** that will grow and adapt with the needs of the community and advances in smart contract development. We encourage the community to engage actively with this project—whether by contributing ideas, identifying gaps, or proposing enhancements.

In the spirit of OWASP’s mission, this standard seeks to improve the security posture of the smart contract ecosystem, safeguarding both developers and users alike. We sincerely thank all contributors, and we look forward to your continued support in shaping the future of secure smart contract development.

**Together, we can build a safer decentralized future.**
