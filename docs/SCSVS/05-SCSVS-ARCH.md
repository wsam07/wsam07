# S1. Architecture, Design, and Threat Modeling

## Control Objective
Establish a robust architectural foundation and design framework that incorporates threat modeling and security best practices. The goal is to proactively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities during the early stages of smart contract development. This ensures the system's scalability, security, and efficiency, while adhering to the principles of secure Solidity coding and deployment.
