## S5.2 Oracle Integrations

### Control Objective
Ensure that oracle integrations provide secure, reliable, and tamper-proof data feeds while maintaining data integrity and handling failures appropriately.

### S5.2.A Secure Data Feeds

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S5.2.A1      | Verify that the smart contract uses oracles that provide secure and tamper-proof data feeds, including checks for data integrity and authenticity. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.A2      | Ensure that the smart contract validates the data received from oracles to prevent malicious or incorrect data from affecting contract operations. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.A3      | Check that the smart contract includes fallback mechanisms in case of oracle failure or unreliable data. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.A4      | Verify that the integration with oracles follows best practices for data security, including encryption and secure communication channels. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.A5      | Ensure that the smart contract's oracle integration is designed to handle any potential discrepancies or conflicts in data from multiple sources. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |

### S5.2.B Decentralized Oracles

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S5.2.B1      | Verify that the smart contract uses decentralized oracles to enhance data reliability and prevent single points of failure or manipulation. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.B2      | Ensure that the smart contract includes mechanisms to validate the consensus or majority opinion of decentralized oracles before taking actions based on their data. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.B3      | Check that the smart contract accounts for potential latency or delays in data from decentralized oracles to maintain operational reliability. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.B4      | Verify that the smart contract includes checks to prevent manipulation or collusion among decentralized oracles. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S5.2.B5      | Ensure that the decentralized oracle integration adheres to standards for security and reliability in multi-oracle environments. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
