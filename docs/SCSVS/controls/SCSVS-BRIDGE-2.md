## S9.2 Data Privacy

### Control Objective
Ensure that sensitive data within contracts is secured and that privacy measures are effectively implemented.

### S9.2.A Ensuring Sensitive Data is Secure

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |

### S9.2.B Zero-Knowledge Proofs

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S9.2.B1      | Verify that zero-knowledge proofs are implemented to ensure privacy without revealing any underlying data. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S9.2.B2      | Validate the correctness of proof generation and verification processes to prevent any potential leaks or exploits. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S9.2.B3      | Ensure that zero-knowledge proofs are integrated seamlessly with the blockchain to maintain performance and security. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |

### S9.2.C Private Transactions

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S9.2.C1      | Verify that private transaction mechanisms (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) are correctly implemented to ensure confidentiality of transaction details. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S9.2.C2      | Ensure that private transactions maintain the integrity and validity of the blockchain. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |

### S9.2.D Confidential Contracts

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S9.2.D1      | Verify that confidential contracts use cryptographic techniques to hide contract state and execution details from unauthorized parties. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S9.2.D2      | Ensure that only parties with appropriate permissions can access data within confidential contracts. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
