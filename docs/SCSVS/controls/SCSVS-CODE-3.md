# SCSVS-CODE-3

## S2.3 Test Coverage

### Control Objective
Ensure comprehensive test coverage for smart contracts, encompassing unit tests, integration tests, and security-specific tests, to identify vulnerabilities and maintain code quality throughout development.

### S2.3.A Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Automated Testing

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S2.3.A1      | Verify that all critical functions in the smart contract have comprehensive unit tests that cover both typical and edge cases. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.A2      | Ensure that integration tests are implemented to validate the interactions between the smart contract and other contracts or external systems. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.A3      | Check that automated tests are set up to run on each code commit to detect regressions and maintain continuous quality of the smart contract. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.A4      | Verify that test coverage tools are used to monitor and achieve a high percentage of coverage for the smart contract code. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.A5      | Ensure that the testing framework supports mocking and simulating external dependencies to effectively isolate and test specific functionalities of the smart contract. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |

### S2.3.B Security-Specific Tests

| **SCSVS&nbsp;VR&nbsp;ID**          | Requirement                                                                 | L1 | L2 | L3 | SWE |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| S2.3.B1      | Verify that the test suite for the smart contract includes security-specific tests designed to identify vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows, and improper access controls. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.B2      | Ensure that the security tests validate proper implementation of access controls and permissions within the smart contract. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.B3      | Check that fuzz testing is conducted to uncover unexpected behaviors and potential security issues under various input scenarios. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
| S2.3.B4      | Verify that the smart contract's response to invalid inputs and edge cases is thoroughly tested to ensure robust security measures are in place. |    | ✓  | ✓  |     |
