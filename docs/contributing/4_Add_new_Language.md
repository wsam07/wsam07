## SCSTG Translations

The SCSTG is a living document that changes and adapts to the most recent security recommendations every day. While we do want to reach the maximum audience possible, our past experience shows that **maintaining translations has proven to be an extremely challenging task**. Therefore, please understand that **any PRs containing SCSTG translations will be declined**, but you're free to do them on your own forks.
